I'm an Engineer at HashiCorp in the Terraform Ecosystem team - I got started in Support, then got into Development mostly in .net and ended up working @OpenTable where I was a bridge between Developers and Operations.  After a couple of years working with various clouds and automation tools - I’ve now been at HashiCorp for about a year where I’m working on the Azure Terraform Provider.
