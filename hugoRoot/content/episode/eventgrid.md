Description = """Please join the Event Grid program manager Bahram Banisadr, and our hosts Pete Roden 
and David Barkol to learn about Azure Event Grid. We will discuss how the product compares to Service Bus 
and Event Hubs and review how it works with other IaaS and PaaS services to make integrations easier! 
<br/><br/>
Azure Event Grid is a fully-managed intelligent event routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using 
a publish-subscribe model. Use Azure Event Grid to react to relevant events across both Azure and non-Azure services 
in near-real time fashion. Learn how to use Azure Event Grid with our quickstarts, tutorials, and samples."""
