Description = """The new Azure Storage podcast features senior Storage program manager Karl Rautenstrauch giving an overview of the new features in Azure Storage services, 
and how Microsoft customers can leverage them to maximize business value! 
<br/><br/>
Microsoft Azure Storage is a Microsoft-managed cloud service that provides storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. 
Microsoft takes care of maintenance and handles critical problems for you. Azure Storage consists of three data services: Blob storage, File storage, and Queue storage. 
Blob storage supports both standard and premium storage, with premium storage using only SSDs for the fastest performance possible. 
Another feature is cool storage, allowing you to store large amounts of rarely accessed data for a lower cost."""
